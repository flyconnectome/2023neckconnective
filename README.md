# 2023neckconnective
This repository collates the annotations and example code of the St√ºrner and Brooks et al. "Comparative connectomics of the descending and ascending neurons of the Drosophila nervous system: stereotypy and sexual dimorphism" paper that combines FAFB, FANC and MANC neck connective neurons. The annotation data will be available to download here and have also been contributed to the portals of the three dinsinct datasets: https://codex.flywire.ai for FAFB, https://github.com/htem/FANC_auto_recon/wiki for FANC (not yet included) and https://neuprint.janelia.org/ for MANC. 

Annotations are used by the [fafbseg-py](https://fafbseg-py.readthedocs.io/) Python and the [fafbseg](https://natverse.org/fafbseg/) R package for programmtic analysis of the FAFB-Flywire dataset, the [malevnc](https://natverse.org/malevnc/) R package for the MANC dataset and [fancr](https://flyconnectome.github.io/fancr/) R package for the FANC dataset. Altenatively the [coconatfly](https://natverse.org/coconatfly/) package enables integrative connectomics across these three datasets.

## Annotations

## Software tools
All software used in this paper is open-source and available through Github. Some of it was specifically developed for comparative analysis across the thee datasets (coconatfly). Please open an issue in the respective repository if you have questions or run into problems.

### Python

| Name             | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| [navis](https://github.com/navis-org/navis)            		   | Analysis and visualisation of neurons. Used e.g. for NBLAST.  |
| [navis-flybrains](https://github.com/navis-org/navis-flybrains)  | Used to transform data between template spaces (e.g. from hemibrain to FlyWire). |
| [fafbseg-py](https://github.com/flyconnectome/fafbseg-py)           | Query and analyse FlyWire data (segmentation, meshes, skeletons, annotations). |
| [cocoa](https://github.com/flyconnectome/cocoa) | Analysis suite for comparative connectomics. Enables e.g. hemibrain-FlyWire connectivity clustering. |
| [neuprint-python](https://github.com/connectome-neuprint/neuprint-python)  | Query neuPrint instances (e.g. for the hemibrain). Developed by FlyEM (Janelia Research Campus). |

The recommended entry point for Python is [fafbseg-py](https://github.com/flyconnectome/fafbseg-py).
